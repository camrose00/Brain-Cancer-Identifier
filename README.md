This dataset is a collection of 4600 images of brain x-rays of patient diagnosed of brain tumor posted on 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset? resource=download by Preet Viradiya. The dataset is split into two categories: healthy 
and tumor. 2513 of the images are cancerous brains and 2087 of them is healthy.
A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the brain. Two main groups of brain tumor are termed as benign tumor and malignant(cancerous) tumor. The 
purpose of the dataset is analyzing the image data of x-rays to identify the tumor, pinpoint its location, and assess the function of the brain. Due to the 
complexity in sizes and locations of the brain tumor, utilizing the machine learning algorithms will improve the efficiency and accuracy in detecting and 
classifying the tumor. As expected, we hope we could identify the kind of the tumor and detect its location effectively. The method will be helpful for 
brain tumor diagnosis and treatment in the medical system. In this dataset, we explore computer vision. Moreover, the question we seek to answer is can we 
develop a model to indicate early signs of cancer in brains? The business perspective is more of a humanitarian perspective with the goal of saving lives 
by identifying cancer cells before it's too late. .
